## Day-scheduler

## Description 

 This project consists in a web calendar application.
 It gives the user the opportunity to save events for each hour of the day. 
 The calendar page can:
* Display the current day at the top.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* After an event has passed the user is not allowed to modify it.

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page
  
 The website should look similar to the screenshots below:
